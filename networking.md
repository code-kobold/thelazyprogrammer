# Networking

This certainly is not about connecting to other coders, but about making network connections - local or remote.

## nc (~ netcat)
Open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning.

### Open TCP connections (~ telnet)

`:~$ nc -v 192.168.0.8 18988
